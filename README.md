# SoundLoad
The goal of this project is to help all SoundCloud users save their favorite songs 
with as much data as possible preserved. I made this to simplify the process of 
porting SoundCloud songs to other platforms, which can be very tedious normally. 
If you value the use of local files, I strongly suggest apple music. They have an 
extremely simple and well featured local files system compared to the shitty 
alternative that spotify provides, which doesn't even work for most people.

If you prefer porting music to Spotify or Apple Music, you should not enable AAC 
downloads, as neither platforms will play them. The difference in bitrate is
negligible anyway, so this should only be used if you care about archiving.

## Usage
A SoundCloud client ID is required for every use unless saved to `cfg.json`.
</br> ( *Use `-CID` & `-save` to store a CID* )

### Getting a new client ID
- Open browser dev tools (`ctrl+shift+i`)
- Go to the network tab
- Go to [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com)
- Filter URL's with "client_id="
- Find a request with a client ID in it

## Examples

### Setting basic config info
By running this, the client ID, audio output dir, and cover art output dir will be saved to cfg.json. Note that creating
a local files folder for spotify like shown in this example makes importing songs to spotify extremely quick.
```
c:>sl -cid cWww6yL0wMOcwhn4GEYjHVAg3mwMPBis -audio-dst "c:/spotify local files" -img-dst "c:/cover art" -save
```

### Downloading a song
This will download the song, name the audio file "Extra Stixx", and set the contributing artists to "Pook G, Lul Jody".
Other metadata will be automatically scraped from the page, but can of course be set manually.
```
c:>sl https://soundcloud.com/fat-kid-915108395/exrta-stixxs-ft-pook-g-lul -audio-name "Extra Stixx" -artists "Pook G, Lul Jody"
```

### Downloading an album
Songs are downloaded in order of last to first, with track numbers automatically parsed. If you want more 
control over each track in the album, download them independently.
```
c:>sl https://soundcloud.com/axxturel/sets/s-kkkult-s-kkkult-s-kkkkult
```

### Downloading cover art
By using the `-art` arg, you tell the program to seperately download the cover art from the track. It 
should be noted that this option can be saved to cfg.json. This is useful for anyone archiving 
underground music, where cover art is often changed or lost to time. The `-n-audio` arg is also used 
and saved, preventing an MP3 from being downloaded.
```
c:>sl https://soundcloud.com/sellasouls/bdayy-sexxx -n-audio -art -save
```

## Notes
- `nlohmann::json::value` has multiple modifications in this repo - check `pch.hpp` for more info.
- There is full unicode support both on command line and in parsing metadata, though it's tedious to 
  actually get proper encoding on command line in Windows.
- In the `comments` property of downloaded audio tags, the program will store the exact timestamp 
  of the upload, the original description, and the original tags. You can easily add on to this list 
  in `site_api.cpp/sc_upload::sc_upload()` by using the `add_comment` lambda.
- The following characters will be replaced with an underscore in file names: `< > : " \ | ? *`
- Go+ songs cannot be downloaded (may work if you use a CID generated by a Go+ account, not tested).
- `cfg.json` must not be modified manually for now. The json library I'm using doesn't have std::wstring
  support, causing it to store such types in extremely stupid ways. Only touch if you know what you're doing.
  This will be fixed later.
